Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to explore the ShopEase e-commerce platform.

You can start modifying the pages by editing the files in the pages directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the files.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/* and serves as the API routes for the ShopEase platform.
