# ShopEase E-Commerce Platform - Backend

Welcome to the backend of the ShopEase e-commerce platform. This project is built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

The backend also utilizes [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database, [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as the ORM, and [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) for database migrations. The project is containerized using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and includes a CI/CD pipeline.

## Getting Started

To get the backend up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ianMuchesia/Shop-Ease.git
    cd Shop-Ease/server
    ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:

    ```bash
    docker build -t shopease .
    ```

3. **Run the Docker container**:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 shopease
    ```

Now, the backend should be running at http://localhost:8000.

## API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation for your application. Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to explore the API endpoints and their responses.

## Database Migrations

We use Alembic for database migrations. To generate a new migration script, use the following command:

```bash
alembic revision -m "Your message"
```

To apply the migrations, use:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the ShopEase backend. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.

## Deployment

The backend is ready to be deployed using any platform that supports Docker. For detailed deployment instructions, refer to the platform's documentation.

Remember to replace the repository URL and other specific details with your own.
